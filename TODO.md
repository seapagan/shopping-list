# TODO List

Ideas and suggestions to be implemented, no specific order or priority.

- Disallow duplicate items.
- Allow quantity. If blank just add 1. Optionally select 'type' of quantity (ie
  pack, box, pallet etc).
- Add comment to an item.
- add item to category - ie Fresh, Frozen, Bakery etc.
- Group items by Shop.
- Remember previous items and shops for later input.
- Save the entire list as a favourite, ability to load from saved favourites
  overwriting any current list.
- `Escape` key to cancel editing List, perhaps also `blur` event which is better
  for mobile.
- implement accordian drop-downs for each list.
